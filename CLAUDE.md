## Security Guidelines

- Never run destructive commands without confirmation
- Always warn about potential data loss before executing risky operations
- Require explicit confirmation for operations that could lose implemented code

## Project Structure

- `/scripts/` - Installation and setup scripts
- `/templates/` - Project templates
- `/config/` - Configuration files
- `/tests/` - Tests and validation
- `/utils/` - Helper utilities
- `/.claude/` - AI assistant configuration and roles

## Coding Guidelines & Development Instructions

### Strict Rules

- Code, code comments, and user messages must be in English (see [Multilingual Team Communication](docs/contributing/README.md#multilingual-team-communication))
- Communication with team members can be in their preferred language, but documentation remains in English
- When implementing new features, always check existing project structure first
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do not add "Generated with [Claude Code]" signatures to code or files
See docs/contributing/CODE-STYLE-*.md for language-specific guidelines
- Don't add "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" to code or other files
- **NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" to code files or git commits** - attribution not required

### General Principles

- Follow existing conventions and styles in the project
- Always explore existing code before creating new implementations
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- All program text (messages, labels, constants) in English
- Comments in English, written as phrases (no ending periods)
- English is the official project language per multilingual team guidelines

### TODO Management

- Follow the established TODO format: `TODO:NNN [INITIALS]: description` (see [TODO Guidelines](docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md))
- Use per-file sequential numbering (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Refer to [docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md](docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md) for complete standards
- Use `TODO:XXX` as temporary placeholder, then request proper numbering

### Issue Tracking & Documentation

- Issues are managed per project individually
- May sync to GitHub repositories when applicable
- Common issue types: Configuration issues, build problems, compatibility issues

### Team Communication

- English is the primary language for all project communication (see [Multilingual Team Communication](docs/contributing/README.md#multilingual-team-communication))
- Use simple, clear English to accommodate non-native speakers
- Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, and culture-specific references
- Team initials assignment follows collision resolution (JS → JSm if JS exists) (see [Team Initials Assignment](docs/contributing/README.md#team-initials-assignment-and-collision-resolution))

### AI Assistant Guidelines

- Claude Code is the preferred AI assistant with pre-configured context
- Alternative AI tools require users to prepare their own context materials
- Follow established AI assistant best practices in [docs/contributing/AI-ASSISTANTS.md](docs/contributing/AI-ASSISTANTS.md)

### Translation Workflow

- Use `.translated/` directory structure for team member translations
- Follow ISO 639-1 language codes (cs, de, fr, etc.)
- Refer to [docs/contributing/TRANSLATION-WORKFLOW.md](docs/contributing/TRANSLATION-WORKFLOW.md) for complete process
- Translations are temporary and can be regenerated as needed

### Repository Management

- Main branch is `main` (not `master`)
- Issues tracked in project-specific locations
- License: Proprietary - CassandraGargoyle team only
- Gitea format: git@gitea:CassandraGargoyle/Api
- GitHub format: <https://github.com/CassandraGargoyle/api>

### System Information Detection

- **Always use** `portunix system info` for OS detection when Portunix is available
- **Only if Portunix is not available**, then use manual detection methods
- Don't write custom OS detection scripts when Portunix already provides this functionality
