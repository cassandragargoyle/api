## Security Guidelines
- Never run destructive commands without confirmation
- Always warn about potential data loss before executing risky operations
- Require explicit confirmation for operations that could lose implemented code
- Follow secure coding practices for {{PRIMARY_LANGUAGE}}

## Project Structure
- `/docs/` - Documentation including contributing guidelines
- `/src/` - Source code
- `/config/` - Configuration files
- `/tests/` - Tests and validation
- `/scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `/templates/` - Project templates (if applicable)

## Coding Guidelines & Development Instructions

### Strict Rules
- Code, code comments, and user messages must be in English (see [Multilingual Team Communication](docs/contributing/README.md#multilingual-team-communication))
- Communication with team members can be in their preferred language, but documentation remains in English
- When implementing new features, always check existing project structure first
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do not add "Generated with [Claude Code]" signatures to code or files
- Use established project patterns and conventions

### General Principles
- Follow existing conventions and styles in the project
- Always explore existing code before creating new implementations
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- All program text (messages, labels, constants) in English
- Comments in English, written as phrases (no ending periods)
- English is the official project language per multilingual team guidelines

### Language-Specific Guidelines
{{LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_GUIDELINES}}

### TODO Management
- Follow the established TODO format: `TODO:NNN [INITIALS]: description` (see [TODO Guidelines](docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md))
- Use per-file sequential numbering (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Refer to [docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md](docs/contributing/TODO-GUIDELINES.md) for complete standards
- Use `TODO:XXX` as temporary placeholder, then request proper numbering

### Issue Tracking & Documentation
- Issues are managed per project individually
- May sync to GitHub repositories when applicable
- Api-specific issues: {{COMMON_ISSUE_TYPES}}

### Team Communication
- English is the primary language for all project communication (see [Multilingual Team Communication](docs/contributing/README.md#multilingual-team-communication))
- Use simple, clear English to accommodate non-native speakers
- Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, and culture-specific references
- Team initials assignment follows collision resolution (JS → JSm if JS exists) (see [Team Initials Assignment](docs/contributing/README.md#team-initials-assignment-and-collision-resolution))

### AI Assistant Guidelines
- Claude Code is the preferred AI assistant with pre-configured context
- Alternative AI tools require users to prepare their own context materials
- Follow established AI assistant best practices in [docs/contributing/AI-ASSISTANTS.md](docs/contributing/AI-ASSISTANTS.md)

### Translation Workflow
- Use `.translated/` directory structure for team member translations
- Follow ISO 639-1 language codes (cs, de, fr, etc.)
- Refer to [docs/contributing/TRANSLATION-WORKFLOW.md](docs/contributing/TRANSLATION-WORKFLOW.md) for complete process
- Translations are temporary and can be regenerated as needed

### Repository Management
- Main branch is `main` (not `master`)
- Issues tracked in project-specific locations
- {{LICENSE_TYPE}} license - {{LICENSE_SCOPE}}
- Links use format: git@gitea:CassandraGargoyle/Api
